# Hi, I'm Ati (aka McBlueFrog)

I’m a multidisciplinary hardware and embedded systems engineer working across electronics, robotics, bionics, firmware, and mechanical design.  
If it has wires, gears, signal noise, or moves in a slightly cursed manner, I'll probably build it, rebuild it, and debug it at 2 AM.  
I also love computers — one day I swear I'm going to build one myself (after finishing my bucket list of 2000 other things).

Founder of **Mechaxil** (DIY open-hardware kits) and **Bionixia** (my personal bionics R&D blacksite).

## What My Brain Thinks I Do
- Elegant PCB design  
- Clean firmware development  
- Maintain healthy sleep cycles  

## What I Actually Do
- Forget to re-import new components until the PCB screams  
- Rewire entire circuits because they look ugly  
- Reprint mechanical parts eight times to fix a 0.2 mm gap  
- Add features no one asked for because *why not*  
- Write Python scripts at ungodly hours because automation = happiness  
- Attempt Rust → suffer → continue anyway  
- Be too lazy, ask ChatGPT → get annoyed by ChatGPT → do 90% of it myself anyway even this was made by that clancker

# Projects Taking Over My Life

## Bionic Arm
A fully 3D-printed prosthetic arm powered by EMG signals and servo mechanisms.  
Modular, open-source, constantly evolving.

## EMG Wristband
An EMG acquisition band for gesture control and prosthetics.  
Still deciding whether it reads muscles or dark magic.

## Mechaxil
DIY electronics kits for people who want to learn hardware without selling a kidney.

# Tech I Work With

### Microcontrollers
Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, STM32  
(trying to catch them all like Pokémon)

### Languages
Python, C, Rust, Zig  
(you cannot convince me to use JavaScript, please stop trying)

### CAD and Graphics
Fusion 360, Krita

### Game Dev
Unreal Engine 4 (UE5… yeah no), Raylib, Blender, Audacity

### AI and Computer Vision
YOLO training (dataset suffering included)

### Mechanical Interests
If it moves, it's automatically cool.

# Currently Learning
- Embedded Rust  
- Mechanical engineering fundamentals  
- How not to overengineer everything  
  (status: catastrophic failure)

# Fun Fact
I don’t choose my projects.  
**They choose me.**  
Usually at 1 AM.
