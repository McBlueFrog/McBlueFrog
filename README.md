# Hi, I'm Ati (aka McBlueFrog)

I’m a multidisciplinary hardware and embedded systems engineer working across electronics, robotics, bionics, firmware, and mechanical design.  
If it has wires, gears, signal noise, or moves in a slightly cursed manner, I'll probably build it, rebuild it, and debug it at 2 AM.  
I also love computers — one day I swear I'm going to build one myself (after finishing my bucket list of 2000 other things).

Founder of **Mechaxil** (DIY open-hardware kits) and **Bionixia** (my personal bionics R&D blacksite).

# Projects Taking Over My Life

## Bionic Arm
A fully 3D-printed prosthetic arm powered by EMG signals and servo mechanisms.  
Modular, open-source, constantly evolving.

## EMG Wristband
An EMG acquisition band for gesture control and prosthetics.  
Still deciding whether it reads muscles or dark magic.

## Mechaxil
DIY electronics kits for people who want to learn hardware without selling a kidney.
